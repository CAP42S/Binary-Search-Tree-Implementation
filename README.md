Binary Search Tree Implementation in Java
==========================================
This program simulates a binary search tree, a type of data structure commonly used in computer science. The binary search tree is implemented as an abstract data type using an interface, allowing it to handle a wide range of data instances.

Features
========
The binary search tree implementation includes the following features:

*Insertion of new elements
Deletion of existing elements
Searching for elements
Traversal of the tree
The implementation also includes optimizations and algorithms that improve performance, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.

Usage
=====
To use the program, simply compile and run the source code, or integrate the binary search tree implementation into a larger project. The interface allows users to customize the binary search tree implementation to their specific needs, making it more flexible and versatile.

About
=====
The implementation is written in Java and uses an interface to provide a more general data structure for all types of data instances. With this implementation, you can easily manage and manipulate data in a sorted order, making it a powerful tool for a wide range of applications.
